# Introduction {#sec:intro}

When a population is subdivided across multiple habitats with different 
environmental conditions, the extent to which distinct subpopulations can
maintain locally beneficial genetic variation depends on the rate of migration
between them.
Migration between populations that maintain divergently selected alleles can
generate migration load (a reduction in mean fitness due to the influx of
locally maladaptive genes) or may lead to loss of local adaptation altogether
(so-called *swamping* by gene flow) [e.g.  @lenormand2002].
While local adaptation may be driven by a few conspicuous loci (e.g. adaptive
melanism in peppermoths [@hof2016] or pocket mice [@nachman2003]), it is
believed to typically be polygenic, involving alleles of different effect at
many loci across the genome [@pritchard2010; @lecorre2012; @barghi2020;
@bomblies2022; @stankowski2023; @westram2018].
When local adaptation is polygenic, migration from a population adapted to
different environmental conditions will generate linkage disequilibria (LD)
among selected loci, and the rate at which each individual invading locally
deleterious allele is eliminated will be affected by such associations, a
phenomenon often referred to as a 'coupling' effect 
[@barton1983; @kruuk1999; @feder2012; @yeaman2015; @sachdeva2022].
Such coupling effects will in turn affect the equilibrium migration load and
swamping thresholds for the loci under selection.
Neutral variation may also come to be associated with locally selected alleles,
so that the latter constitute a 'barrier' to neutral gene flow, increasing
neutral genetic differentiation (as quantified by $F_{\mathrm{ST}}$ for
instance) beyond the single locus neutral expectation [@bengtsson1985].

Barrier effects due to divergent local adaptation at many loci may play an
important role in the evolution of reproductive isolation, and hence speciation
[@barton2020; @nosil2012].
The colonization of a new habitat will often involve selection on polygenic
traits and give rise to a subpopulation that exhibits some divergence from its
ancestors [@barton2018].
Conditional on the initial succesful establishment of such a divergent
subpopulation, whether or not speciation ensues depends on whether local
adaptation can be maintained in the face of maladaptive gene flow (if any), and
on the extent to which the partial reproductive isolation deriving from local
adaptation may promote further divergence and strengthen reproductive
isolation, either through reinforcement, coupling with intrinsic
incompatibilities, or the establishment of additional locally beneficial
mutations [@barton2009; @bierne2011; @butlin2018; @kulmuni2020].
In this paper, we focus on the conditions under which polygenic local
adaptation can be maintained in the face of maladaptive gene flow, assuming
local fitness to be determined by an additive trait under directional
selection.

Despite mounting evidence that local adaptation is indeed often polygenic
[@bomblies2022], little is known about the underlying genetic details:
How many loci are involved? What are the typical effect sizes? Are locally
beneficial alleles typically closely linked or spread all over the genome? How
non-additive is local adaptation? *etc.* [e.g. @yeaman2011b; @yeaman2015;
@bomblies2022].
Moreover, even if such details were known, a number of open questions remain as
to how the genetic architecture of local adaptation affects the ability of a
population to maintain reproductive isolation in the face of gene flow. 
For instance, it is not directly obvious whether a heterogeneous architecture
comprising both loci of small and large effect would admit more adaptive
differentiation than a homogeneous architecture with the same average selective
effect per locus.
The closely related question of how much scope there is to infer the detailed
genetic architecture underlying local adaptation from observed patterns of
genomic differentiation, as for instance obtained through so-called 'genome
scans', also remains largely unanswered.
So far, most theoretical models have assumed rather simple architectures,
dealing with biallelic loci with additive and equal effects on fitness
(ignoring dominance and epistasis), that are either unlinked or uniformly
spread along a block of genome [@barton1983; @fraisse2021b; @sachdeva2022]; and
statistical approaches for the inference of gene flow across the genome either
make similarly crude assumptions [@aeschbacher2017], or ignore the genetic
details of local adaptation altogether [@roux2013; @fraisse2021; @laetsch2022].

In a recent paper, @sachdeva2022 showed that, when the loci under selection are
unlinked, the effects of LD on equilibrium differentiation at any individual
locus in a multilocus barrier can be well described by classical (deterministic
or stochastic) single locus population genetic theory, provided that the
migration rate $m$ is substituted by an *effective* migration rate $m_e$
[@petry1983; @bengtsson1985; @barton1986; @kobayashi2008], which captures how
gene flow at a focal locus is affected by selection against the associated
genetic background.
The effective migration rate for a neutral locus can furthermore serve as a
quantitative measure of reproductive isolation (RI), i.e. $\RI = 1-m_e/m$
[@westram2022].
Crucially, $m_e$ depends itself on the frequencies of divergently selected
alleles, giving rise to feedback effects where a small increase in migration
rate may cause a sudden collapse of local adaptation (i.e. swamping).
In her paper, @sachdeva2022 conducted a detailed study of the joint effects of
drift and LD on swamping thresholds and neutral differentiation
in the mainland-island and infinite-island models of population subdivision,
assuming a haploid sexual life cycle and divergently selected loci of equal
effect.
In this paper, we extend the theoretical framework outlined in @sachdeva2022,
deriving an expression for the effective migration rate for a polygenic genetic
architecture with arbitrary fitness and dominance effects across loci (referred
to as a *heterogeneous* architecture or barrier) in a population with a
haplodiplontic life cycle (which includes haplontic and diplontic life cycles
as special cases).
We use this $m_e$ to build an approximation for the marginal allele frequency
distributions at migration-selection balance in a mainland-island model, 
and use these tools to assess how the effects of multilocus LD (i.e. coupling
effects) on swamping thresholds and the genetic architecture of reproductive
isolation depend on dominance, drift, life cycle assumptions and heterogeneity
in fitness effects across loci.

# Model and Methods

## Haplodiplontic mainland-island model {#sec:model}

Here we outline a mainland-island model for a sexual population which may be
subject to selection in both the haploid and diploid phases.
We think of this model as a caricature of a bryophyte, pteridophyte, algal or
fungal population, but as we shall see below, the model encompasses both
diplontic and haplontic life cycles as well.
Throughout, we shall assume that sexes need not be distinguished.
We assume a regular and synchronous alternation of generations, where an island
population of $N$ haploids (gametophytes) produces an effectively infinite pool
of gametes from which $2Nk$ gametes are sampled that unite randomly to form $N
k$ diploid individuals (sporophytes), $k$ being the number of diploids per
haploid individual.
The diploid generation produces in turn an effectively infinite pool of haploid
spores through meiosis, of which $N$ are drawn to form the next haploid
generation.
In each generation, we assume $M$ haploid individuals on the island are
replaced by haploid individuals from a mainland population, where $M$ is
Poisson distributed with mean $Nm$.
Fitness on the island is determined by $L$ unlinked biallelic loci which are
under divergent selection relative to the mainland.
The mainland population is assumed to have a constant, but arbitrary, genetic
composition.
Unless stated otherwise, we shall assume the mainland to be fixed, at each
locus, for the locally deleterious allele on the island.
Fitness effects are allowed to vary arbitrarily across loci.
Denoting the alleles at locus $i$ by $A_{i,0}$ and $A_{i,1}$, we designate by
$w_{i,j}$ the relative fitness of the haploid genotype $A_{i,j}$ and $w_{i,jk}$ the
relative fitness of diploid genotype $A_{i,j}A_{i,k}$.
We suppress the index $i$ when considering a generic locus.
We assume throughout that $w_0 = 1$ and $w_1 = e^{s_1}$ for the haploid phase,
and $w_{00} = 1, w_{01} = w_{10} = e^{s_{01}}$, and $w_{11} = e^{s_{11}}$ for
the diploid phase.
Throughout, we denote the frequency of the allele with relative fitness $1$ (on
the island) at locus $i$ by $p_i$, and the frequency of the alternative allele
by $q_i = 1-p_i$.
Fitness is determined multiplicatively across loci, so that, for instance, the
log relative fitness of a haploid individual fixed for all the '1' alleles
(genotype $A_{1,1},A_{2,1}, \dots, A_{L,1}$) is given by $\log w = \sum_{i=1}^L s_{i,1}$.
We assume that each haploid (diploid) individual contributes gametes (spores)
to the gamete (spore) pool proportional to its fitness.
We assume symmetric mutation at a small constant rate $u$ per locus, occurring
at meiosis.

Individual-based simulations of this model are implemented in a Julia package
[@julia] available at
[`https://github.com/arzwa/MultilocusIsland`](https://github.com/arzwa/MultilocusIsland).
In the following sections, we build up a theoretical approximation to this
fairly general multilocus model, and validate the approximations by comparing
numerical results against individual-based simulations.
We first derive the dynamics at a single locus, considering both deterministic
and stochastic models.
Next, we derive an approximation to the effective migration rate for the
multilocus model using a rather general argument based on the reproductive
value of migrant individuals.
Lastly, we approximate the allele frequency dynamics of the multilocus model by
plugging in the effective migration rate, which captures the effect of LD among
selected alleles on the dynamics at a neutral locus, in the single locus
theory.


## Single locus mainland-island model

### Deterministic dynamics {#sec:sldet}

We first consider a deterministic model for the allele frequency dynamics at a
single locus, ignoring the influence of the other loci as well as genetic
drift. 
As shown in detail in @sec:app1, for weak selection and migration, the
dynamics of $p$ can be described in continuous time by the nonlinear ordinary
differential equation (ODE)
\begin{equation}
   \frac{dp}{dt} = -m(p-p^\ast) -q(s_ap + s_bpq)\ ,
   \label{eq:ode}
\end{equation}
where $p^\ast$ is the frequency on the mainland of the allele which is beneficial
on the island, $s_a = s_1 + s_{01}$ and $s_b = s_{11} - 2s_{01}$, the latter
being a measure of dominance (i.e. the deviation from multiplicative fitnesses,
sometimes called $\iota$ [@otto2003; @manna2011]).
Usually, $s_1, s_{01}$ and $s_{11}$ will be assumed to be negative, and $p^\ast$
will be assumed to be small, so that selection increases $p$, whereas migration
decreases $p$. 
When $s_1 = 0$, we obtain the standard diploid mainland-island model, which is
commonly parameterized in terms of a dominance coefficient $h$ and selection
coefficient $s$, so that $s_{01} = sh$ and $s_{11} = s$.
When $s_1 \ne 0$ (i.e. there is selection in the haploid phase), we can
define an effective selection coefficient $s_e = 2s_1 + s_{11}$ and
dominance coefficient $h_e = \frac{s_1 + s_{01}}{2s_1 + s_{11}}$ (except when
$s_e = 0$), so that, under weak selection, the single locus dynamics for an
arbitrary haplodiplontic life cycle can be described by a diploid model with
these effective parameters.
The equilibria of @eq:ode are analyzed in detail in @sec:mieq.


### Diffusion approximation to the stochastic dynamics

Still considering a single locus, we now account for the effects of
drift.
Denoting by $X_n$ and $Y_n$ the number of $A_1$ copies in the $n$th haploid,
respectively diploid, generation, the life cycle as outlined in @sec:model
corresponds, for a neutral locus, to the following Markov chain model:
  \begin{align}
  Y_n|X_n &\sim \Bin\left(2Nk, \frac{X_n}{N}\right) \label{eq:mc1} \\
  X_{n+1}|Y_n &\sim \Bin\left(N, \frac{Y_n}{2Nk}\right). \label{eq:mc2}
  \end{align}
Note that one unit of time corresponds to a single *alternation* of
generations, involving two sampling stages: first we sample $2Nk$ gametes
from an infinite pool of gametes with allele frequency $X_n/N$ for the $A_1$
allele (@eq:mc1), next we sample $N$ haploid genotypes from an infinite pool
of haploid spores where the allele is at frequency $Y_n/2Nk$ (@eq:mc2).
This model is akin to the standard Wright-Fisher (WF) model with variable
population size, regularly alternating between $N$ and $2Nk$ gene copies.
The corresponding effective population size is hence $N_e = (N^{-1} +
(2Nk)^{-1})^{-1}$, twice the harmonic mean of the phase-specific number of gene
copies [@hein2004] (twice because our unit of time is an alternation of
generations, not a single generation).

A similar Markov chain model can be defined for a selected locus with migration
and mutation, but we will not consider this explicitly here, immediately
considering a diffusion approximation instead.
When evolutionary forces are sufficiently weak, diffusion theory can be applied
to approximate the equilibrium allele frequency distribution implied by such a
Markov chain by a continuous density $\phi(p)$ of the form
\begin{equation*}
  \phi(p) \propto V(p)^{-1} \exp\left[2\int_0^p \frac{M(x)}{V(x)}dx\right],
\end{equation*}
[e.g. @felsenstein2005],
where for the haplodiplontic mainland-island model, the infinitesimal mean and
variance will be, respectively,
  \begin{align*}
  M(p) &= -q(s_ap + s_bpq) + u(q - p) - m(p - p^\ast) \\
  V(p) &= N_e^{-1} pq\ ,
  \end{align*}
where we assume mutations occur with rate $u$ for both alleles. This yields a
probability density function for the equilibrium allele frequency distribution
  \begin{equation}
  \phi(p; N_e, u, m, s) \propto p^{2N_e(u+mp^\ast)-1}q^{2N_e(u+mq^\ast)-1}e^{N_e(2s_aq + s_bq^2)},
  \label{eq:phi}
  \end{equation}
where no closed form expression is known for the normalizing constant.  This is
essentially Wright's distribution, generalized to a haplodiplontic life cycle
[@wright1937].


## Multilocus model {#sec:ml}

### Effective migration rate

We now derive an expression for the effective migration rate $m_e$, which
captures the reduction in gene flow at a focal locus embedded in a genotype
with multiple selected loci due to LD.
As shown formally in @kobayashi2008, for weak migration, the reduction in gene
flow relative to the 'raw' migration rate $m$, termed the *gene flow factor*
(gff), depends on the expected reproductive value (RV) of migrants in the
resident background (i.e. the expected long-term contribution of a migrant
individual to the neutral gene pool on the island, relative to individuals in
the resident island population).
At any time, the proportion of individuals with recent migrant ancestry on the
island is $O(m)$, so that the probability of individuals with migrant
backgrounds mating with each other to produce, for instance, F2 crosses of the
migrant and resident genotypes, is $O(m^2)$, and hence negligible for
sufficiently weak migration.
The descendants of a migrant individual will therefore most likely correspond
to F1 and subsequent backcross generations, so that to a good approximation,
the RV of a migrant individual depends on the relative fitnesses of F1, BC1,
BC2, *etc.* individuals.

Let $W_h^{(n)}$ and $W_d^{(n)}$ denote the relative fitness of an individual
derived from an $n$th generation haploid, respectively diploid, backcross of an
initial migrant individual with the resident population (i.e. $W_d^{(1)}$ is the
relative fitness of an F1 diploid, $W_d^{(2)}$ of an offspring from a F1
$\times$ resident cross (BC1 generation), *etc.*).
Assuming migration occurs in the haploid phase before selection, the gff can be
expressed as
\begin{equation}
  g = \frac{m_e}{m} = \Ex\left[W_h^{(0)}\prod^\infty_{n=1}W_d^{(n)}W_h^{(n)}\right],
\end{equation}
where $W_h^{(0)}$ is the relative fitness of the haploid migrant in the resident
population [@westram2022; @barton2018; @sachdeva2022].
Note that this involves an expectation over all possible lines of descent of an
initial migrant spore.
In practice, $g$ is determined only by the first 10 backcross generations or
so, as subsequent backcrosses are essentially indistinguishable from residents.
In order to derive a useful approximate expression for $g$, we shall make two
further important assumptions:
(1) both the resident and migrant gene pool, as well as each backcross
generation, is in Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium (HWLE);
(2) the expected allele frequency at any locus in any backcross generation is
midway between that of the parents (e.g. the mean of the mainland and island
allele frequencies for the F1 generation).
In reality, due to Mendelian segregation, individuals inherit not exactly half
of the selected alleles of each parent, and this segregation variance will lead
to variation within F1s, BC1s, *etc.* on which selection can act.
This will cause deviations from the midparent value which are $O(s^2)$, so that
this last assumption becomes more plausible when local adaptation is due to
more and more loci of smaller effect.

Under these assumptions, each of the $W^{(n)}$ is determined solely
by the frequencies of the selected alleles in the mainland and the island
populations at the assumed equilibrium.
This allows us to determine $\Ex[q_i^{(n)}]$, the expected frequency of the
locally deleterious allele (in the island) at locus $i$ among $n$th generation
descendants from a migrant, in terms of the allele frequencies in the mainland
and island population.
Indeed, assumption (2) implies the recursive relation $q_{i}^{(n)} =
\frac{1}{2}(q_i^{(n-1)} + q_i)$, i.e. the average number of selected alleles
carried by an $n$th generation backcross is the mean of the number of such
alleles carried by an $(n-1)$th generation backcross and a resident individual.
Hence, we have $\Ex[q_i^{(n)}] = \frac{1}{2^n}(q_i^\ast + (2^n - 1)\Ex[q_i])$.
Denoting the selection coefficient at locus $i$ for the haploid phase by
$s_{i1}$, the expected relative fitness of an $n$th generation haploid
descendant is
\begin{align*}
\Ex\left[W_h^{(n)}\right] \approx \frac{\exp\left[\sum_{i=1}^L s_{i1}\Ex[q_i^{(n)}]\right]}
                          {\exp\left[\sum_{i=1}^L s_{i1}\Ex[q_i]\right]} 
  = \exp\left[2^{-n}\sum_{i=1}^L s_{i1}(q_i^\ast - \Ex[q_i])\right],
\end{align*}
where we have assumed that per-locus selection is sufficiently weak that
$O(s^2)$ terms can be ignored.
For the diploid phase, a similar argument shows that for the $(n+1)$th
generation,
\begin{align*}
\Ex\left[W_d^{(n+1)}\right] 
  &= \exp\left[2^{-n}\sum_{i=1}^L s_{i01}(q_i^\ast - \Ex[q_i]) 
    - s_{i,b}(p_i^\ast\Ex[q_i] - \Ex[p_iq_i])\right],
\end{align*}
where $s_{i01}$ and $s_{i11}$ are the selection coefficients against
heterozygotes and homozygotes at locus $i$ respectively, and where, analogous
to the single locus model, $s_{i,b} = s_{i11} - 2s_{i01}$.
Putting everything together, the approximate gff becomes
\begin{align}
g 
 &\approx \Ex\left[W_h^{(0)}\right]\prod_{n=1}^\infty 
    \left(\Ex\left[W_d^{(n)}\right] \Ex\left[W_h^{(n)}\right]\right)
 \nonumber \\
 &=\prod_{k=0}^\infty \exp\left[ 
    2^{-k}\sum_{i=1}^L s_{i,a}(q_i^\ast - \Ex[q_i]) - 
    s_{i,b}(p_i^\ast \Ex[q_i] - \Ex[p_iq_i])\right] \nonumber \\
&=\exp\left[2\sum_{i=1}^L 
    s_{i,a}(q_i^\ast - \Ex[q_i]) - s_{i,b}(p_i^\ast\Ex[q_i] -
    \Ex[p_iq_i])\right],
    \label{eq:gff}
\end{align}
where, similarly, $s_{i,a} = s_{i1} + s_{i01}$.
It is worth stressing that the gff is a function of the differentiation between
the mainland and island population as well as the heterozygosity $\Ex[pq]$ on
the island, and that, although we assume migration is sufficiently rare, we do
*not* assume that alleles introduced by migrants are rare.
We shall often highlight the dependence of the gff on the allele frequencies
and heterozygosities by writing $g[\Ex[p], \Ex[pq]]$, or $g[p]$ when allele
frequencies are deterministic. 
Note further that @eq:gff corresponds to $(\Ex[W_h^{(0)}]\Ex[W_d^{(1)}])^2$, i.e.
the product of the relative fitness of a haploid migrant in the haploid
resident population and the relative fitness of the diploid F1 in the diploid
resident population, squared.
Hence, $g$ can, in principle, be determined empirically. 

If we assume all loci to have the same selection and dominance coefficient (a
*homogeneous barrier*), and that the mainland is fixed for the locally
deleterious allele on the island, @eq:gff can be simplified to
\begin{equation}
  g = e^{-2Ls_eh_e\Ex[p]}e^{-2Ls_e(1-2h_e)\Ex[pq]}
  \label{eq:eqeff2}
\end{equation}
where we have expressed $s_a = -s_eh_e$ and $s_b = -s_e(1-2h_e)$ in terms of the
effective selection coefficient $s_e$ against the invading allele, and the
effective dominance coefficient $h_e$ of the invading allele over the locally
beneficial one (see @sec:sldet).
Here, the first factor is just the gff associated with a haploid $L$-locus
system with selection coefficients $s_eh_e$.
The second factor captures the effects of dominance and depends on the
heterozygosity $\Ex[pq]$.  Clearly, $h_e$ has opposing effects on both factors.
The immediate effect of dominance is therefore that the gff is decreased
(barrier strength increased) relative to the additive case whenever invading
alleles exhibit a dominant deleterious effect on the island ($h_e > 1/2$).
Only when heterozygosity ($\Ex[pq]$) becomes appreciable does the second factor
contribute to the increase (when $h_e > 1/2$) or decrease (when $h_e < 1/2$) of
the gff.
The implications of these observations for the maintenance of adaptive
differentiation will be explored in detail in the results section.

Two remarks are due. Firstly, the gff as derived above yields the effective
migration rate at an unlinked neutral locus.
We can calculate the gff at a selected locus by making the assumption that it
is the same as that of a hypothetical neutral locus at the same location -- an
assumption which is only expected to work well if selection at the focal locus
is sufficiently weak.
Hence, if we wish to calculate the effective migration rate for a selected
locus in the barrier, say locus $j$, the relevant gff is obtained by excluding
index $j$ from the sum in @eq:gff.
Secondly, as in the model outlined in @sec:model, we have assumed that
migration occurs at the start of the haploid phase, reflecting a process such
as spore dispersal.
However, it should be emphasized that, while the details of when migration
occurs in the life cycle do not matter for the single locus model as long as
selection and migration are sufficiently weak (so that the continuous-time
limit is appropriate), these details *do* matter for the effective migration
rate.
This is because, although selection *per locus* is weak ($s$ being small),
selection against migrant genotypes can be strong ($Ls$ being appreciable).
Thus, when migration is due to dispersal of gametes (e.g. pollen dispersal),
the first generation experiencing selection on the island will be the diploid
F1 generation, so that the appropriate gff under the same approximation is
$g/\Ex[W_h^{(0)}]$.
Secondly, when migration occurs at the beginning of the diploid phase (e.g.
seed dispersal), the first generation experiencing selection will
consist of diploid migrant individuals, so that $g\Ex[W_d^{(0)}]$ is the
appropriate gff, where
\begin{equation*}
  \Ex[W_d^{(0)}] \approx
    \frac{e^{\sum_i^L 2p_i^{\ast}q_i^{\ast}s_{i,01} + q_i^{\ast 2}
        s_{i,11}}}{e^{\sum_i^L2\Ex[p_iq_i]s_{i,01} + \Ex[q_i^2]s_{i,11}}}
    = \exp\left[\sum_{i=1}^Ls_{i11}(q_{i}^\ast - \Ex[q_i]) - 
    s_{i,b}(p_i^\ast q_i^{\ast} - \Ex[p_iq_i])\right].
\end{equation*}
If the haploid, diploid and gametic migration rates are $m_1, m_2$ and $m_3$
respectively, the effective migration rate will be $(m_1 + \Ex[W_d^{(0)}] m_2 +
\Ex[W_h^{(0)}]^{-1}m_3)g$.
Unless stated otherwise, in the present work, we shall assume migration to be
due to dispersal of haploid spores, so that @eq:gff gives the relevant gff.


### Dynamics and equilibria for the multilocus model {#sec:dynamics}

The gff captures the effect of LD among selected loci on the rate of gene flow
from the mainland into the island at any individual locus.
The key observation is that a certain separation of time scales applies:
although selection against migrant *genotypes* can be very strong in the
polygenic case (of magnitude $Ls$, roughly), selection at any individual locus
is still assumed to be weak, so that, when linkage is weak or absent,
LD among selected loci becomes negligible after an evolutionarily short period
in which entire sets of alleles are efficiently removed together.
Hence, on the longer time scales at which migration-selection balance is
attained, the allele frequency at any individual locus should essentially
follow the single locus dynamics, with LD reducing the effective migration rate
by a factor equal to the gff [@sachdeva2022].
As a consequence, in the deterministic case, we expect that the effects of LD
should be well captured by substituting the effective migration rate $m_e = mg$
for $m$ in @eq:ode.
Specifically, we get a system of $L$ coupled differential equations, where for
$1 \le j \le L$,
\begin{equation}
   \frac{dp_j}{dt} = -m g_j[p_{-j}]p_j - q_j(s_{j,a}p_j + s_{j,b}p_jq_j),
   \label{eq:odeme}
\end{equation}
where we assumed the mainland to be fixed for the deleterious allele
on the island at all loci.
Here we write $g_j[p_{-j}]$ for the gff as in @eq:eqeff2, to highlight the
dependence of the gff at locus $j$ on the allele frequencies at the other $L-1$
loci.
Note that in the deterministic model, the expected values in @eq:gff
disappear, i.e. at any time $\Ex[q_j] = q_j$ and $\Ex[p_jq_j] = p_jq_j$. 
We study the equilibria of this model by numerically solving for $p$ at
stationarity ($\dot{p}_j = 0$, for $1 \le j \le L$).

As in @sachdeva2022, we can also plug $m_e$ into the single locus diffusion
approximation to determine the equilibrium allele frequency distribution for
each locus on the island.
Specifically, we postulate that the joint distribution of allele frequencies
factorizes as
\begin{align}
  \phi(p) = Z^{-1} \prod_{j=1}^L \phi_j(p_j|p_{-j}) = 
    Z^{-1}\prod_{j=1}^L \phi(p_j; N_e, u, mg_j[p_{-j}], s_j),
  \label{eq:mrf}
\end{align}
where $Z$ is a normalizing constant and $\phi$ was defined in @eq:phi.
@Eq:mrf can be thought of as the distribution associated with a Markov random
field over the complete graph with $L$ vertices.
The marginal allele frequency distribution at any particular locus depends on
the allele frequencies at the other $L-1$ loci.
We can compute moments of the allele frequency distribution at each locus by
solving the whole system self-consistently, that is, by assuming 
\begin{align*}
  \Ex[p_j] &= Z_j^{-1}\int p_j \phi(p_j, N_e, u, mg_j[\Ex[p_{-j}],
      \Ex[pq_{-j}]],s_j) dp_j \\
  \Ex[p_jq_j] &= Z_{j'}^{-1}\int p_j q_j \phi(p_j, N_e, u, mg_j\left[\Ex[p_{-j}],
      \Ex[pq_{-j}]\right], s_j) dp_j,
\end{align*}
where the $Z$'s are again normalizing constants, and $\Ex[pq_{-j}]$ is the
vector of expected heterozygosities at all loci excluding locus $j$ (i.e.
$(\Ex[p_1q_1], \dots \Ex[p_{j-1}q_{j-1}], \Ex[p_{j+1}q_{j+1}], \dots,
\Ex[p_Lq_L])$).
To solve this system of $2L$ nonlinear equations, we use the fixed point
iteration outlined in @sec:fp.
The numerical methods used in this paper are also implemented in the Julia
package available at 
[`https://github.com/arzwa/MultilocusIsland`](https://github.com/arzwa/MultilocusIsland).

### Realized genetic architecture of local adaptation

To determine the realized genetic architecture of local adaptation at
migration-selection balance for heterogeneous barriers, we calculate the
conditional probability density for the selection and dominance coefficient at
a locus, given that a divergent allele is observed on the island for that
locus, i.e.
\begin{align}
  f(s_i,h_i|X_i=1) 
  &= \frac{\Pr\{X_i=1|s_i,h_i\}f_{\mathrm{DFE}}(s_i,h_i)}{\Pr\{X_i=1\}} 
  \propto \int_\mathcal{B} \Ex[p_i|s_i,h_i,B]f_{\mathrm{DFE}}(s_i,h_i,B)dB,
  \label{eq:msbdfe}
\end{align}
where $f_\text{DFE}$ denotes the joint density of the selection and dominance
coefficient in the $L$-locus barrier, $X_i$ is an indicator random variable
(equalling 1 when a randomly sampled allele on the island at locus $i$ is of
the locally beneficial type and zero otherwise), $B$ is a shorthand for the
selection and dominance coefficients at the $L-1$ other loci ('$B$' for
background), and we integrate over the set of all possible such backgrounds
$\mathcal{B}$.
Note that $f_\text{DFE}$ is equivalent to $f(s_i,h_i|X_i=1)$ in the absence of
migration.
For a given DFE model, we can characterize this conditional probability density
using a Monte Carlo approach by sampling random $L$-locus genetic architectures
from the DFE and calculating for each $(s_i,h_i)$ pair in the barrier the
expected beneficial allele frequency $\Ex[p_i|s_i,h_i,B]$ as a weight.
The weighted sample will be distributed according to $f$.


# Results

The results are organized as follows: we start with an analysis of the
deterministic multilocus system, examining the effects of LD on equilibrium
allele frequencies and contrasting the roles of dominance in the single locus 
model with the multilocus model, neglecting drift and heterogeneity of
selective effects across the barrier.
We next consider the effects of genetic drift and investigate how equilibrium
allele frequencies on the island depend jointly on the population size, the
strength of migration relative to selection at a single locus, the extent
of LD, and dominance.
We also consider the role of selection in both the haploid and diploid phase of
a biphasic life cycle, showing how life cycle details can be accurately dealt
with using a set of effective parameters.
Lastly, we study the effects of heterogeneous barrier architectures on the
maintenance of local adaptation and patterns of equilibrium differentiation.

## Multilocus barriers with dominance in the deterministic model

We first analyze the deterministic multilocus model for a homogeneous barrier.
We shall assume the mainland to be fixed for the locally deleterious allele (in
the island habitat) at all loci.
We only consider diploid selection here, with $s_{01} = -sh$ and $s_{11}
= -s$, where $s$ is the selection coefficient against the locally deleterious
allele, and $h=s_{01}/s_{11}$ is the dominance coefficient.
We emphasize that $h$ measures dominance *of the mainland (invading) allele
over the island (locally beneficial) allele*, so that $h=1$ corresponds to a
situation where the invading allele is fully dominant, or, equivalently, where
the allele that confers local adaptation on the island is recessive.
For the case where migration is at the haploid stage, restricting the analysis
to diploid selection incurs no loss of generality, as haploid selection then
simply amounts to a rescaling of the dominance and selection coefficients (see
methods).
The effective (diploid) dominance coefficient when there is haploid selection
with intensity $s_1$ will be $h_e = \frac{s_1+s_{01}}{2s_1+s_{11}}$, so that
the effect of haploid selection is to pull $h_e$ towards the additive case
($h=1/2$) where selection acts on each gene copy independently, as it does in a
strictly haploid model.

### Effect of dominance on equilibrium frequencies

![
Recessive local adaptation leads to stronger multilocus barriers to gene flow.
Equilibrium frequencies ($\tilde{p}$) of the locally beneficial alleles are shown for
increasing $Ls$ for \uline{(A)} the case of dominant local adaptation (recessive
migrant alleles), \uline{(B)} additive fitness effects and \uline{(C)} recessive local
adaptation.
Note that the mainland is fixed for the alternative allele, so that $\tilde{p}$
corresponds to the differentiation at equilibrium.
The thick lines show the stable equilibria for increasing $m/s$, whereas the
dotted lines show unstable equilibria.
The black dots mark the critical point beyond which swamping is obtained for
any initial condition (in (C) the approximate expression from @sec:supdet is
used).
The results for $Ls=0.01$ (gray lines) correspond to the single locus
predictions.

\uline{(E, F)} Barrier strength $b[q] = g[q]^{-1}$ as a function of the
deleterious allele frequency $q$ on the island for different degrees of

decrease when $h < 1/3$.
](/home/arthur_z/vimwiki/build/img/2023-07-17/detdom.svg){#fig:detdom}

In the homogeneous deterministic model, all loci have the same dynamics if the
initial allele frequencies are equal.
From @eq:odeme, we find that in that case, the frequency $p$ of the locally
beneficial allele at any selected locus in an $L+1$ locus system must satisfy
at equilibrium
\begin{align}
   0 &= shpq + s(1-2h)pq^2 -mg[p]p 
   \label{eq:odeq} \\
   &\qquad\text{where}\ g[p] = e^{-2Ls(hp + (1-2h)pq)}. \nonumber
\end{align}
We can solve this numerically for the equilibrium allele frequency.
Note that if we set $g[p] = 1$, we recover the classical diploid single locus
model, for which the equilibrium behavior is well understood [@haldane1930VI;
@nagylaki1975].
We briefly recapitulate the main results for the single locus model (see also
@sec:mieq, and the gray lines in @fig:detdom).
For the case $h=0.5$ (no dominance, also referred to as codominance, or
additivity), the equilibrium frequency $\tilde{p}$ of the locally beneficial
allele decreases linearly from $1$ to $0$ as the rate of migration
approaches the strength of selection per allele $s/2$.
When local adaptation is due to a dominant allele (so that the invading allele
acts recessively to reduce fitness on the island, i.e. $h=0$), the migration
rate beyond which no polymorphism can be maintained is increased to $s$, while
$\tilde{p}$ is decreased relative to the additive case as long as $m <
s/4$.
When local adaptation is due to a recessive allele ($h=1$), the model has two
equilibria, one stable equilibrium $\tilde{p}_+ > 1/2$ and one unstable
equilibrium $\tilde{p}_- < 1/2$, as long as $m$ does not exceed $s/4$.
When this critical threshold is passed, swamping occurs for any initial
frequency.
Below this threshold, i.e. for $m<s/4$, whether or not polymorphism is
maintained depends also on the history of the population: the island population
cannot fix a new recessive beneficial variant, but an established recessive
variant can be maintained upon secondary contact. Similar bistable behavior
occurs for partial recessivity as long as $h > 2/3$.

We now consider equilibrium behavior in the multilocus case, where LD will
cause deviations from single locus predictions.
@Fig:detdom shows the equilibrium behavior for a number of example parameter
sets.
As expected, stronger net selection against maladapted genotypes (stronger
coupling, i.e. larger $Ls$) increases the equilibrium frequency of the locally
beneficial allele relative to the single locus prediction, but the magnitude of
this effect depends quite strongly on dominance.
When invading alleles are recessive ($h=0$; @fig:detdom A), gene flow is
not at all impeded when deleterious alleles are rare on the island (the gff
being near one; @fig:detdom E, F).
This is essentially because, irrespective of how many deleterious alleles a
migrant carries, deleterious alleles will not be found in homozygotes as long
as migration is sufficiently weak, and hence will not be 'seen' by selection.
Only once deleterious alleles are segregating at appreciable frequencies on the
island, are F1, BC1, *etc.* individuals likely to be homozygous at several
loci, thus exposing (partially) recessive invading alleles to selection and
reducing the RV of migrants.
As a result, when invading alleles act recessively, a strong genome-wide
barrier effect emerges only once differentiation falls below a critical
threshold. 
The situation is clearly different when migrant alleles are dominant, as
invading alleles will immediately express their full load in the resident
population, irrespective of the alleles on the other haplotype, yielding
efficient selection against migrant alleles (the gff being at its minimum when
migrant alleles are rare, @fig:detdom E, F).
Any increase in the frequency of the deleterious allele on the island will
merely increase the expected relative fitness of individuals with migrant
ancestry, and hence reduce the efficiency of selection.
We observe a transition between these two qualitatively different types of
behaviour at intermediate values of $h$: when $h<1/3$, the barrier strength, as
measured by $g^{-1}$ [@barton1986], *increases* as the locally deleterious
allele increases in frequency on the island (and hence as differentiation
between mainland and island *decreases*), decreasing the rate of gene flow,
until a value of $q=(3h-1)/(4h-2)$ is reached (@fig:detdom, E, F).


### Effect of dominance on swamping thresholds

In the single locus model, arbitrarily small frequencies of the locally
beneficial allele can be maintained at migration-selection balance when $h <
2/3$, whereas in the case of $h > 2/3$, a sharp swamping threshold is observed
as the locally beneficial allele reaches some critical frequency $p_c \le 1/2$
(@sec:mieq, gray lines in @fig:detdom).
@sachdeva2022 showed that such sharp thresholds for swamping also appear in
the absence of dominance due to coupling effects.
LD both increases the critical migration rate ($m_c$) at which swamping occurs
and the minimum level of differentiation that can be maintained before the
swamping point is reached ($p_c$).
Our results indicate that dominance has a considerable influence on how LD
sharpens and displaces swamping thresholds (@fig:detdom D, @sec:supdet).
For $h<2/3$ (i.e. when local adaptation is not strongly recessive), the
critical migration threshold for swamping increases once $Ls$ is sufficiently
large (as in the additive case), albeit only marginally for moderate levels of
divergence ($Ls < 2$, say) (@sec:supdet, @fig:pplot).
This is in sharp contrast with the case where local adaptation is due to
strongly recessive alleles ($h > 2/3$), where the threshold for swamping increases
rapidly with $Ls$ (@fig:detdom D).
Importantly, the critical differentiation ($p_c$) level below which local
adaptation collapses is strongly affected by dominance.
In the additive case, one can show that sharp thresholds for swamping emerge as
soon as $Ls > 1$ (@sec:supdet), in which case $p_c = 1-1/Ls$, and hence
arbitrary differentiation can be maintained near the critical point depending
on $Ls$.
For completely dominant local adaptation ($h=0$), however, $p_c$ increases from
$0$ to a maximum of $1/2$ as $Ls \rightarrow \infty$, whereas for recessive
local adaptation ($h=1$), $p_c$ increases from $1/2$ to $1$ as $Ls$ grows.
This means, in particular, that for moderate levels of divergence, $Ls > 0.75$
say, and large population sizes, one would not expect to see locally beneficial
recessives at frequencies much below $0.8$, compared to $0.5$ for the single
locus model (@fig:detdom C).
@Fig:detdom further highlights the nontrivial feedbacks between the observed
differentiation and dominance: whereas a consideration of the gff in a regime
where migrant alleles are rare would suggest that swamping thresholds and
equilibria depend roughly on $Lsh$, and not on $Ls$ and $h$ separately, this
intuition really only works well for very small rates of migration (@fig:lsh).


## Accounting for drift 

While the deterministic analysis points towards important effects of dominance
on equilibrium differentiation and thresholds for swamping when local
adaptation is polygenic, it is important to assess to what extent these carry
over to finite populations.
Indeed, @sachdeva2022 showed that, for small values of $N_es$, the sharp
thresholds for swamping predicted by deterministic multilocus theory need not
apply, and that the critical migration rate may be significantly reduced.
Furthermore, as long as selection is not much stronger than drift (i.e. $N_es$
is not very large), the observed frequency of a locally adaptive allele (and
hence differentiation between the mainland and island) at
migration-selection-drift balance may deviate substantially from the
deterministic limit, so that it becomes important to understand the
*distribution* of allele frequencies at equilibrium on the island.

![
Genetic drift reduces the strength of a homogeneous multilocus barrier to gene
flow.
\uline{(A)}
Predicted allele frequency distributions for a single locus in the diploid
multilocus model with homogeneous selective effects for different values of
$N_e$ and $h$ (dominance coefficient of the invading alleles).  Lines show the
numerical approximations based on the diffusion theory, dots show results from
individual-based simulations, based on taking a sample every 10 generations for
50000 generations after an initial 10000 generations to reach equilibrium.
In these simulations, $s = 0.02$, $Ls = 1$ and $u/s = 0.005$.
\uline{(B)}
The expected frequency of the locally beneficial allele ($\Ex[p]$)
is shown as a function of $N_es$ and $m/s$ for different values of $Ls$ (from
\uline{left} to \uline{right}, $Ls = 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2$) and $h$ (from \uline{top}
to \uline{bottom}, $h=0, 0.5,
1$), computed using the numerical approximation.
All results assume $s=0.02$ and $u/s=0.005$. See also @fig:drifthm1 and
@fig:drifthm3.
](/home/arthur_z/vimwiki/build/img/2023-06-17/drift-homo-ep-af.svg){#fig:drifthm}

We find that substituting $m_e = mg[\Ex[p],\Ex[pq]]$ for $m$ in the
single-locus diffusion theory and solving self-consistently for $\Ex[p]$ and
$\Ex[pq]$ (see @sec:dynamics) yields a remarkably accurate approximation to
individual-based simulations of the model with arbitrary dominance.
Indeed, even in parameter regimes where the approximation is expected to break
down ($Ls$ appreciable with $L$ small and $s$ large, small population size) we
obtain good predictions (@fig:Lsdom).
Not only can we reliably obtain the expected frequency of alleles on the
island, we also obtain very good predictions for the entire allele frequency
distribution (@fig:drifthm A).
The sharp swamping thresholds observed in the deterministic model, in
particular with recessive local adaptation ($h=1$), correspond to strongly
bimodal allele frequency distributions in the stochastic model.
As described in more detail in @sec:init, this may render our numerical
approaches sensitive to the assumed initial state of the island population.
This sensitivity is itself biologically relevant, corresponding to assumptions
on the (recent) history of the populations considered at equilibrium.
Throughout, we shall assume a scenario of secondary contact, so that the island
starts as fixed for the locally beneficial allele at all loci. 

For a homogeneous genetic architecture, the swamping threshold at any
individual locus depends on the total barrier strength (coupling strength)
$Ls$, the dominance coefficient $h$, and the strength of selection per locus
relative to drift $N_es$.
Concomitantly, for any given $m/s$, these three key parameters will determine
jointly whether significant adaptive differentiation is to be expected at a
particular locus (@fig:drifthm B).
Unsurprisingly, the general consequence of genetic drift is to reduce the
barrier effect, hence decreasing the expected differentiation at equilibrium
(@fig:drifthm B; @fig:drift).
Swamping thresholds are both decreased and made less sharp by drift, and the
detailed behavior depends on the dominance coefficient.
In the case with recessive local adaptation ($h=1$), we see that sharp
thresholds for swamping appear even when drift is quite strong ($N_es > 4$,
say), and that, as $Ls$ increases, the critical $m/s$ value increases rapidly
with increasing $N_es$ (@fig:drifthm B, bottom row).
As expected from the deterministic theory, sharp thresholds for swamping in the
additive and dominant case appear once $Ls > 1$, but only when drift is not too
strong (@fig:drifthm B, middle and top row).
Considering, for instance, the predictions for $Ls = 2$ (@fig:drifthm B,
rightmost column), we see that for the additive case, a sharp threshold
appears roughly when $N_es > 10$, whereas for the dominant case this only
happens near $N_es > 20$.
In the case where local adaptation is dominant, we now see clearly that when
$N_es$ is substantial (e.g. $N_es=16$ in @fig:drift), two phases can be
distinguished as $m/s$ increases.
As noted above, the barrier strength initially increases with migration as
deleterious alleles increase in frequency on the island, exposing more invading
recessives to selection.
However, above a certain critical deleterious allele frequency
($\Ex[q]>q_c>0.5$), the barrier strength starts to decline again with
increasing $m$ (@fig:drift, $h=0$ and $h=0.25$ panels).
This contrasts with the recessive case, where a positive feedback between the
gff and the frequency of the deleterious allele generates a sharp threshold for
swamping once a critical frequency $q_c<0.5$ is surpassed.


## Selection in both the haploid and diploid phase

We now consider in more detail the case when selection acts both in the haploid
and diploid phase.
We parameterize the general model in such a way that we can investigate, for a
given total barrier strength,
the effects of the relative strength of selection in the diploid and the
haploid phase and the degree of dominance ($h$) in the diploid phase.
To this end, we assume
\begin{align}
   s_1 = -(1-\tau)s & & s_{01} = -h\tau s & & s_{11} = -\tau s,
   \label{eq:hapdipmodel}
\end{align}
where $0 \le \tau \le 1$ measures the relative strength of selection in the
diploid phase (if one assumes selection to operate with constant intensity
throughout the life cycle, this can be interpreted as the relative length of
the diploid phase).
Similar models have appeared in the study of life cycle modifiers [e.g.
@otto1994; @scott2017].
Recall furthermore that we assume a regular alternation of $N$ haploid and $Nk$
diploid individuals.
@Fig:domtau shows that we can accurately predict equilibrium allele frequencies
for haplodiplontic life cycles with selection in both phases using the
diffusion approximation, which depends on $N, k, s, h$ and $\tau$ only through
$N_es_e = N_e(2-\tau)s$ and $h_e = (1 - \tau(1-h))/(2-\tau)$, where $N_e =
(N^{-1} + (2Nk)^{-1})^{-1}$, showing that, at least for weak selection, life
cycle details can be accounted for by means of suitable effective parameters
(@fig:hapdipeff).

![
Multilocus migration-selection balance and swamping with dominance and
haploid selection.
For a given total barrier strength ($Ls$, see main text), we vary the relative
strength of selection in the diploid and haploid phase ($\tau$, colors) and the
degree of dominance (columns) in the diploid phase.
Specifically, we assume $s_1 = -(1-\tau)s, s_{01} = -h\tau s$ and $s_{11} =
-\tau s$. Hence, $\tau = 1$ corresponds to a diplontic life cycle (or at least,
absence of selection in the haploid phase), whereas $\tau=0$ corresponds to a
haplontic life cycle.
Other parameters were as follows: $Ls =0.8, L=40, N_es=8, k=5, u=s/100$.
The dots show results from individual-based simulations, whereas the lines were
computed using the numerical approximation based on diffusion theory. 
](/home/arthur_z/vimwiki/build/img/2023-04-19/domtau.svg){#fig:domtau}

@Fig:domtau suggests furthermore that, for a given total strength of selection
$Ls$, predominantly haploid populations should be able to maintain more
adaptive variation, and exhibit stronger reproductive isolation, irrespective
of the degree of dominance in the diploid phase.
This is because the effective selection coefficient in the model defined by
@eq:hapdipmodel is $(2-\tau)s$, so that the strength of selection per gene copy
in haploids is twice that in diploids in the absence of dominance.
Therefore, although we have shown in our analyses for diploids above that
recessive local adaptation ($h=1$) can lead to a stronger barrier to gene flow
(if $Ls$ is sufficiently large), increasing the relative strength of diploid
selection ($\tau$) in the haplodiplontic model when locally beneficial alleles
act recessively (thereby increasing $h_e$) does not strengthen the barrier,
because this decreases $s_e$ at the same time.
The relevance of these observations for the evolution and maintenance of
haplodiplontic life cycles is however not very clear, as a life cycle modifier
need not keep the overall strength of selection constant [@scott2017].
Lastly, we note that the phase of the life cycle in which migration occurs can
have an impact on the ability to maintain adaptive differentiation.
When there is selection in both phases, and migration occurs in the diploid
phase, maladapted diploid migrants are directly exposed to selection on the
island, whereas this is not the case when migration occurs in the haploid
phase.
In the latter case, the first diploid generation exposed to selection is an F1
cross between the mainland and island, so that there is no selection on the
homozygous diploid effect.
We would therefore expect that migration in the diploid phase generally leads
to stronger barriers to gene flow when selection acts in both phases, and this
is indeed observed (@fig:dipmig).


## Heterogeneous genetic architectures

We now depart from the unrealistic assumption of equal effects and dominance
coefficients across the polygenic barrier.
In @sec:ml, we developed the multilocus theory for potentially heterogenous
(unlinked) genetic architectures, where the selection coefficients $s_1, s_{01}$
and $s_{11}$ can vary arbitrarily across loci, and we verify that we do indeed
obtain accurate predictions also in this setting (@fig:het).
This allows us to address in more detail a number of questions pertaining to
the genetic architecture of local adaptation at migration-selection balance,
accounting for both LD and genetic drift.
Recall that the scenario we are considering is the following: at some point in
time, the island is colonized by individuals from the mainland and rapid
adaptation to the local conditions from standing genetic variation ensues
(by driving $L$ locally beneficial alleles to high frequencies on the island).
After this initial idealized phase of directional selection on standing
variation, we assume a situation of secondary contact, where, on average, $Nm$
haploid individuals on the island are replaced by mainland individuals in each
generation, and the island evolves to an equilibrium state.
We then ask what sort of loci can contribute to local adaptation and how the
resulting barrier to gene flow leads to observable allelic differentiation.
We also consider to what extent selective interference among loci results in
departures from single locus predictions. 
We emphasize that we do not explicitly consider the buildup of divergence
between the mainland and island population, nor some plausible model for what
sort of standing variation is the source of the initial polygenic response, but
merely ask how a given genetic architecture of local adaptation affects
observable patterns of adaptive differentiation when there is gene flow.
All results discussed in the remaining sections are obtained using the
numerical approximations based on diffusion theory.

### Effect of variation in fitness effects across a polygenic barrier

The effects of variation among selection coefficients on polygenic barriers.
\uline{(A)} The boxplots
show the mean per-locus differentiation ($\bar{\Delta} = \sum_{i}^L
\Ex[p_i]/L$) across the $L$-locus barrier ($L=100$), for 50 replicate
simulations of an additive polygenic barrier where selection coefficients are
distributed according to a $\Gam(\kappa, \kappa/\bar{s})$ distribution, with
$\Ex[s] = \bar{s} = 0.01$ and six different values of $\kappa$
(note that $\mathrm{Var}[s] = \bar{s}^2/\kappa$).
The solid horizontal line shows the predicted equilibrium differentiation per
locus for a homogeneous barrier of strength $L\bar{s}$ (i.e. the prediction
accounting for LD but not for heterogeneity in selection coefficients).
The colored lines show the average differentiation across the barrier predicted
using single locus theory $\sum_i^L{\Ex[p_i|s_i]}/L$, averaged over replicate
simulations (i.e. predictions accounting for heterogeneity, but not LD).

\uline{(B)} Expected beneficial allele frequencies across the barrier in a single
simulation replicate for each of the six assumed distributions, sorted by
allele frequency, assuming $m/\bar{s} = 0.1$ (horizontal lines as in (A);

$u/\bar{s} = 0.005$.
\uline{(C)} As in (A) but for $m/\bar{s} = 0.4$. 
](/home/arthur_z/vimwiki/build/img/2023-09-06/gammas.svg){#fig:gammas}

We first consider the case with variable selection coefficients across the $L$
loci in the barrier, assuming no dominance.
@Fig:gammas (A) shows the average per-locus expected differentiation across the
barrier ($\bar{\Delta}$) when selection coefficients are sampled from a Gamma
distribution ($L=100, L\bar{s}=1$).
When migration is weak relative to selection (roughly $m/\bar{s} < 1/4$),
increasing the variance in fitness effects, while keeping $\bar{s}$
constant, yields on average lower equilibrium differentiation than a
homogeneous barrier of strength $L\bar{s}$, although the barrier strength (as
measured by the average gff across the $L$ selected loci, $\bar{g}$) is hardly
affected (@fig:gffgammas). 
At higher migration rates, where loci with selection coefficients close to
$\bar{s}$ become prone to swamping, heterogeneous architectures tend to yield
higher equilibrium differentiation and a stronger barrier effect than a
homogeneous one with the same total effect $L\bar{s}$ ([@fig:gammas;
@fig:gffgammas]).
One should be careful, however, in the interpretation of $\bar{\Delta}$.
As shown in @fig:gammas (B, C), differentiation across loci in the barrier
often shows a strongly sigmoidal pattern, especially when $\Var[s]$ is large,
where most loci are either strongly differentiated or not at all, and with
rather few loci having $\Ex[p]$ near $\bar{\Delta}$.
This implies that empirically, instead of detecting $L$ selected loci with an
average differentiation of $\bar{\Delta}$, we are more likely to observe about
$L\bar{\Delta}$ strongly differentiated loci.
For low $m/\bar{s}$, the weaker differentiation observed for more heterogeneous
barriers is due to a smaller number of loci effectively contributing to local
adaptation, with about half of the locally beneficial alleles swamped at
$m/\bar{s}=0.1$ while the other half is strongly differentiated (@fig:gammas
B), whereas the increased differentiation relative to the homogeneous case for
larger $m/\bar{s}$ appears to be due to the presence of a larger subset of loci
that resist swamping (@fig:gammas C).
These results are not significantly affected when dominance coefficients are
sampled independently from a symmetric Beta distribution (@fig:gammash).
The effect of increasing $\Var[h]$, while keeping the $s_i$ fixed across the
barrier, is less dramatic than the effect of heterogeneity in selection
coefficients, although we do see systematic increases and decreases in
equilibrium differentiation depending on whether the migration rate exceeds the
swamping threshold for recessives (which are associated with higher equilibrium
frequencies) or not (@fig:betas).

Focusing on a single locus embedded within a heterogeneous barrier, we find
that, for weak migration, variation in selection coefficients across the
barrier has a negligible effect on differentiation at a focal locus with fixed
selective effect, whereas (as already shown in @fig:gammas) it does have a
strong effect on average differentiation across the $L$ loci ([@fig:hetfocal;
@fig:hetfocalb]).
On the other hand, when migration is strong, a locus with selection coefficient
$s$ shows on average higher equilibrium differentiation when embedded in a
heterogeneous barrier than in a homogeneous one, even when the average
differentiation across the barrier is lower in the former ([@fig:hetfocal;
@fig:hetfocalb]).
These results are in line with the observed effect of $\Var[s]$ on $\bar{g}$
(@fig:gffgammas) and indicate that the presence of a small number of loci of
large effect in more heterogeneous barriers can have a strong effect on the
expected differentiation at a focal selected locus (@fig:hetfocal).
As the distribution of selection coefficients is generally believed to be at
least somewhat leptokurtic (note that excess kurtosis $\propto \kappa^{-1}$ for
our Gamma DFE model), these results suggest that heterogeneity in selection
coefficients can have important consequences for observable differentiation at
migration selection-balance that would not be adequately captured by
substituting an average selection coefficient in either single locus or
multilocus theory.

](/home/arthur_z/vimwiki/build/img/2023-06-25/dfe1.svg)

Next we consider how barrier heterogeneity and selective interference affects
different loci in the barrier differently, assuming selection and dominance
coefficients to be independently distributed according to a Gamma and Uniform
distribution respectively (see @sec:dfe).
Comparing the expected differentiation at each locus in a heterogeneous
polygenic barrier to the corresponding single locus predictions for that locus,
we find, as expected, that the extent of selective interference is strongly
dependent on the strength of migration relative to $\bar{s}$ and the total
strength of selection $L\bar{s}$ (@fig:diffdetail), as well as the strength of
genetic drift (@fig:randdiff).
Differentiation is most strongly affected by the multilocus barrier effect for
loci with recessive locally beneficial alleles, at least when $m/\bar{s}$ does
not exceed the swamping threshold for those loci, whereas the deviation from
the single locus prediction for dominant variants is considerably less
([@fig:diffdetail; @fig:hetfocal]).
Again we find that when migration is strong, increased heterogeneity of
selection coefficients in the barrier generally leads to stronger selective
interference, where an appreciable proportion of alleles are protected from
swamping due to a few strongly selected barrier loci (@fig:hetscat;
@fig:hetdens).
@Fig:diffdetail further highlights that, even in the presence of a rather
strong genome-wide barrier effect (e.g. $L\bar{s}=1.5$), we would still expect
to see considerable variation in equilibrium frequencies for locally selected
alleles depending on their individual fitness effects.


### The realized architecture of local adaptation at migration-selection balance

Although the above results indicate that, when $L\bar{s}$ is appreciable, the
effect of selective interference is strongest for recessive alleles
(@fig:diffdetail), this does not, however, imply that recessives necessarily
contribute more to local adaptation at migration-selection balance than
dominant alleles.
Although strongly selected recessives will be associated with strong
differentiation, weakly selected recessive alleles will be more prone to
swamping than partially dominant ones (e.g. @fig:hetfocal).
One way to quantify how these two phenomena interact to yield the *realized*
genetic architecture of local adaptation (related to the concept of *adaptive
architecture*, as defined in @barghi2020)
is by considering the conditional probability density for the selection and
dominance coefficient at a locus, given that a divergent allele is observed on
the island for that locus (see Methods, @eq:msbdfe).
@Fig:diffdetail (B) shows approximations to the marginal distributions
$f(s_i|X_i=1)$ and $f(h_i|X_i=1)$ obtained in this way for the heterogeneous
barrier model assumed in the preceding section.

As expected, we find that as migration rates go up (colors in @fig:diffdetail
B), the distribution of selection coefficients in the barrier at
migration-selection balance shifts towards higher values of $s$, and that this
effect becomes weaker with increasing $L\bar{s}$, which increases the extent by
which small-effect alleles are protected from swamping.
Notably, recessives contribute *less* to adaptation than dominants when
migration is sufficiently strong, despite the fact that, conditional on no
swamping, equilibrium frequencies of recessives are most affected by LD
(@fig:diffdetail A). 
This is most notable when $L\bar{s}$ is not large (top row in @fig:diffdetail).
When $L\bar{s} = 1.5$ for instance, the depression in the conditional density
at $h=1$ becomes very slight even for relatively large migration rates (bottom
row in @fig:diffdetail).
We observe a similar shift in the distribution of dominance coefficients when
$h$ is Beta distributed with mean $2/3$ instead of uniformly on the unit
interval (@fig:dfe1).
It is noteworthy that, despite $s$ and $h$ being independent at each locus in
the barrier, migration-selection balance induces a correlation between $s$
and $h$ in the distribution conditional on observed divergence, with variants
of relatively large effect observed at equilibrium being more likely to act
recessively than variants of small effect (@fig:dfe1j, see also @fig:dfecomp,
top row).
The correlation is negligible for small migration rates, but as the strength of
migration increases so that swamping effects become relevant, the correlation
coefficient can become as large as $0.25$, depending on $L\bar{s}$.

![
The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) affects the realized genetic
architecture of local adaptation at migration-selection balance.
Contour plots for the joint density of $h$ and $s$ conditional on observing a
divergent allele on the island (see @eq:msbdfe) are shown for the three DFE
models (\uline{rows}) for increasing rates of migration (\uline{columns}).
Values of $\bar{\Delta}$ in the lower right corner denote the mean expected
differentiation per locus.
We assume $L\bar{s}=0.8, \bar{s}=0.01, N_e\bar{s}=20, u/\bar{s}=0.005$ and
exponentially distributed selection coefficients, and parameterize the DFE
models so that $\Ex[h] = 2/3$, assuming $\alpha=2, \beta=1$ for the independent
model, $a=7.2, b=1.2, \sigma=1$ for the logistic model and $K=50$ for the CK94
model (see @sec:dfe for details on the different DFE models considered here).
The densities are approximated using a Monte Carlo approach, simulating 500
replicate $L$ locus genetic architectures from the assumed DFE model,
determining the equilibrium allele frequencies for each replicate, and fitting
a kernel density estimate to the sample so obtained.
](/home/arthur_z/vimwiki/build/img/2023-07-17/dfecomp.svg){#fig:dfecomp}


The simple DFE model assumed above where selection and dominance coefficients
are independent is almost certainly inadequate.
Theoretical and empirical work has indicated that, on the one hand, a
correlation between selective effect and degree of dominance can be expected in
the standing genetic variation that forms the basis for a polygenic selection
response, with large-effect alleles more likely to act recessively
[@caballero1994; @zhang2004; @agrawal2011].
On the other hand, it is well appreciated that during the process of
adaptation, different loci enjoy different probabilities of rising to high
frequencies, with dominant beneficial alleles having higher establishment
probabilities than (partially) recessive ones with the same homozygous effect
(Haldane's sieve; @haldane1927, @turner1981). 
These two aspects interact when adaptation is from standing variation, as
the on average higher initial frequency of partially recessive alleles
increases the fixation probability, whereas its recessivity decreases it
[@orr2001].
To examine how the realized genetic architecture of local adaptation depends on
such assumptions, we consider two alternative, admittedly *ad hoc*, DFE models,
outlined in @sec:dfe.
Both models assume Gamma distributed selection coefficients and incorporate a
positive correlation between $s$ and $h$, so that alleles of large effect tend
to be more recessive (recall once more that $h$ in our case is the dominance
coefficient of the invading allele, so $h=1$ corresponds to recessive local
adaptation).
We keep the average dominance coefficient fixed to $2/3$ for each model.
In contrast with the independent model, we find that for the models that
incorporate such a correlation between $s$ and $h$, recessives are typically
more likely to contribute to the realized differentiation at equilibrium
([@fig:dfecomp; @fig:dfe1; @fig:dfe2; @fig:dfe3; @fig:dfe1bj; @fig:dfe2j;
@fig:dfe3j]).
When we make the opposite assumption that locally beneficial alleles tend to be
dominant (corresponding, for instance, to the case with a strong Haldane's sieve
effect during adaptation), we find a somewhat less dramatic shift in the joint
density as migration rates go up (@fig:dfe4). The distribution also shifts
towards higher selection coefficients, but somewhat less so than in the model
with the opposite correlation.
Swamping of partially recessive alleles of small effect further shifts the
distribution towards smaller values of $h$. 
Clearly, these examples show how correlations between $s$ and $h$ among the
loci under divergent selection can have a rather important influence on the
realized genetic architecture at migration-selection balance (i.e. on which
loci actually contribute to adaptive differentiation), driving up the
relative contribution of recessives in one case but not in the other.


# Discussion

## LD and polygenic migration-selection balance

Speciation, in essence, amounts to the buildup and maintenance of linkage
disequilibria [@felsenstein1981], with different sets of alleles maintained
across populations.
Heterogeneous selection can maintain different locally beneficial alleles
across populations at multiple loci.
When migration occurs between such divergently selected populations, sets of
maladaptive alleles are introduced jointly, leading to statistical associations
(i.e. LD) between selected alleles, and possibly strong selection against
migrant alleles, in turn causing (partial) reproductive isolation (RI).
These associations are broken down by recombination, so that the extent to which
RI can be maintained depends on the relative strength of selection, migration
and recombination.
In this paper, we have focused on RI through the maintenance of polygenic local
adaptation in the face of gene flow, assuming a scenario of secondary contact
between two divergently adapted populations that have not diverged too much.
The effects of polygenic selection against maladapted genotypes can be quantified
by the gene flow factor $g$, or the associated effective migration rate $m_e =
mg$, which accounts for the (potentially quite strong) selection against
individuals with recent migrant ancestry and the rapid decay of LD among
surviving invading alleles [@barton1986].
It should be noted that $g$ has a phenotypic interpretation, and can, at least in
principle, be experimentally determined.

We derived an expression for $m_e$ in a mainland-island model with
heterogeneous barriers and a haplodiplontic life cycle, and showed how it can
be used together with classical single locus population genetic theory to yield
accurate predictions of equilibrium allele frequencies on the island.
Importantly, this allows us to study the effects of coupling among barrier loci
without assuming that locally deleterious alleles are somehow rare, enabling us
to study swamping by gene flow in the polygenic setting.
Our results show how the maintenance of adaptive differentiation in the face of
gene flow depends jointly on the extent of LD, drift, dominance and variation
in selective effects across loci.
The general success of the approach indicates two important features of
polygenic migration-selection balance.
Firstly, it suggests that the 'separation of time scales' argument that is at
the root of the approach indeed works, and does so beyond the haploid case with
homogeneous selective effects [as treated in @sachdeva2022].
At least in the unlinked (and probably also weakly linked) case, strong
selection against multilocus genotypes occurs only in the first couple of
generations after a migrant arrives, and the long term fate of a migrant allele
is unaffected by LD conditional on having survived these initial generations.
As a consequence, the effects of LD are well described by the usual single
locus dynamics, but with a reduced migration rate.
Secondly, it indicates that our rather crude approximation to the expected
reproductive value of a migrant individual on the island (which assumes HWLE
within the island population, that migrants only cross with residents, and that
in each such cross the proportion of migrant alleles is exactly halved) is an
adequate estimator of the gff under weak migration.
The approach enables us to study polygenic migration-selection balance in the
mainland-island model using efficient numerical methods, and in particular to
examine the relationship between the genetic architecture of locally adaptive
traits and the ability to maintain adaptive differentiation in the face of gene
flow.


## Effects of dominance and haploid selection in polygenic barriers

Our analyses for homogeneous genetic architectures indicate that, when there is
selection in the diploid phase, dominance can have a considerable impact on both
the extent of adaptive differentiation and the ability to maintain it.
Single locus theory can be somewhat misleading in this regard, in that it tends
to emphasize the relative precariousness of local adaptation due to recessive
alleles in the face of gene flow [because of the lower thresholds for swamping,
e.g. @haldane1930VI; @felsenstein2005], whereas in the multilocus setting,
depending on the total strength of divergent selection ($Ls$), partially
recessive variants may lead to strongly increased swamping thresholds and
produce a much stronger barrier to gene flow than dominant variants with the
same homozygous effect (@fig:detdom).
The reason for this is that for recessive local adaptation, the dominant
invading alleles are immediately exposed to selection, whereas for dominant
local adaptation, the recessive invading alleles can introgress easily as long
as the frequency of the locally deleterious allele is low.
In the extreme case of maximal differentiation and completely dominant local
adaptation, gene flow will be unimpeded whatever the extent of LD when
migration occurs at the haploid stage.
Our results show that the feedbacks between the level of differentiation and
the strength of selection against migrants (as measured by the gff, which
depends on the extent of differentiation) are strongly affected by the degree
of dominance.
It should be emphasized, however, that all our results assume a mainland-island
model of migration and a scenario of secondary contact.
The effects of dominance may turn out to be more subtle in models of population
subdivision with multiple demes and more symmetric patterns of migration, in
which case assumptions on environmental dependence of dominance may become 
important [e.g.  @burger2013]. 

We developed our theory for a fairly general haplodiplontic life cycle, and
showed that a model with selection in both the haploid and diploid phase can be
brought into correspondence with a strictly diploid one through a set of
effective parameters.
Increasing the relative strength of selection in the haploid phase, for a fixed
total strength of selection ($Ls$), yields stronger *effective* selection
(larger $s_e$) at a selected locus, while making the fitness effect more
additive (i.e. $h_e$ moves towards $1/2$).
One might therefore expect that local adaptation would lead to stronger
barriers to gene flow in predominantly haploid species, but it is hard to make
more refined predictions at such a general level.
This relates to recent work on the strength of barriers to gene flow on sex
chromosomes [@fraisse2021b] and in arrhenotokous species [@bendall2022],
where increased exposure to haploid selection generally leads to stronger
barrier effects.
Importantly, similar considerations apply *within* the genome of haplodiplontic
(and even diplontic) species, as there can be considerable variation in the
relative expression levels in both phases across genes within a genome
[e.g. @szovenyi2011; @cervantes2023], so that it is likely that the relative
strength of selection in the phases varies across the genome [@immler2018].
It therefore seems plausible that genes whose expression is biased towards the
haploid phase may contribute more to local adaptation, similar to what has been
described for sex chromosomes versus autosomes [@lasne2017], although this
would of course depend on the relative extent of divergent selection in both
phases.
While general theoretical predictions are challenging to make without numerous
additional assumptions, the fact that life cycle details can be accounted for
using a few effective parameters can be useful in the empirical investigation
of questions related to the relative importance of genetic variation in
haploid-biased versus diploid-biased genes for local adaptation and
reproductive isolation.


## Heterogeneous architectures of polygenic barriers

When migration is not strong relative to the average strength of selection per
locus, increased variation of $s$ in the DFE underlying locally adaptive traits
gives rise to lower overall differentiation at migration-selection balance,
while generating a barrier to gene flow of similar strength ([@fig:gammas;
@fig:gffgammas]).
On the other hand, for high rates of migration, a more heterogeneous
architecture will tend to generate a stronger barrier to gene flow due to the
presence of a larger number of strongly selected loci that resist swamping.
As a consequence, increasing the variation among selection coefficients in a
multilocus barrier (keeping $L\bar{s}$ fixed) leads to stronger differentiation
on average at a focal locus, especially at higher migration rates
([@fig:hetfocal; @fig:hetfocalb]).
Hence, in a polygenic context, observed differentiation at any individual locus
does not only reflect the fitness effect of that locus (i.e. $s_i$ and $h_i$),
but may to a large extent be determined by a genome-wide barrier effect due to
the presence of other divergently selected loci, depending on the number of
barrier loci and their DFE, as well as the migration rate and population size.
Nevertheless, our results also emphasize that, despite appreciable genome-wide
coupling effects, considerable variation in equilibrium differentiation across
non-swamped loci remains, depending on the allele-specific fitness effects
(@fig:diffdetail).
Recent findings such as those of @stankowski2023 emphasize that readily
discovered large-effect loci which bear a clear relationship to locally
adaptive traits may often be associated with a polygenic background whose
causal connection with local adaptation is less obvious.
In line with this, our work suggests that when adaptive divergence ($Ls$) is
appreciable, many loci under weak divergent selection that would be prone to
swamping in isolation may persist due to the presence of a strong enough
barrier.

Our findings concerning heterogeneous genetic architectures bear relevance to
the inference of barriers to gene flow from genomic data.
Recent approaches to quantify gene flow in pairs of diverging populations based
on neutral variation have accounted for heterogeneity in barrier effects by
assuming a demographic model in which the migration rate $m$ (interpreted as
$m_e$) varies along the genome.
[@roux2013](@roux2013) [see also @roux2014; @fraisse2021] assume a model in
which each locus is associated with a locus-specific $m_e$ distributed
according to some genome-wide parametric family, and they infer the shape of
this distribution using their ABC approach, whereas @laetsch2022 conduct
(approximate) maximum likelihood inference of $m_e$ in windows along the
genome, providing a model-based alternative to the popular
$F_{\mathrm{ST}}$-based genome scans.
Both approaches do not explicitly model aspects of the underlying genetic
architecture of divergent selection that is assumed to cause variation in
$m_e$ (and hence introgression probability) across the genome.
So far, the only approach which has attempted to do so is the one proposed by
@aeschbacher2017, where the authors combined information about local
recombination rates together with deterministic population genetic theory
[@aeschbacher2014] to obtain predictions of $m_e$ across the genome.
They assume a set of unobserved selected loci with a fixed selection
coefficient and no dominance to occur with a constant density across the
genome, and infer the selection density per unit of map length (together with
the migration rate) through its effect on observable neutral differentiation.
We wonder, naturally, whether a similar inferential approach, but one allowing
for drift and heterogeneous barrier architectures in the calculation of local
$m_e$ across the genome, could allow for more detailed inferences about the
genetic architecture of local adaptation.
Our results indicate that, if local adaptation is indeed polygenic and
heterogeneous across the genome, and adaptive divergence is substantial, the
scope for detailed inference of the effects of individual loci contributing to
local adaptation may be limited, as localized differentiation will often to
a large extent reflect the genome-wide barrier effect.
Nevertheless, just to what extent we can learn about the detailed genetic
architecture of local adaptation and RI from observed genomic differentiation
remains an open question.


## The genetic architecture of local adaptation at equilibrium

When there is appreciable gene flow, only a subset of the divergently selected
loci that underlie a locally adaptive trait will actually exhibit substantial
differentiation at migration-selection balance, and the DFE of these loci need
not be representative for the DFE associated with all loci underlying the trait
(that is, the *realized* genetic architecture of local adaptation may differ to
greater or lesser extent from the genetic architecture of locally adaptive
traits [@yeaman2011b]).
We find that when selection is fairly weak ($L\bar{s}$ is small), the subset of
divergently selected loci that exhibit significant differentiation at
migration-selection balance constitutes a more biased subset than when
$L\bar{s}$ is large (@fig:diffdetail).
Similarly, the DFE at migration-selection balance shifts more and more to
larger selection coefficients when the strength of gene flow increases
(@fig:diffdetail), whereas the effect on the distribution of dominance
coefficients depends on the correlation between $s$ and $h$ in the DFE
underlying locally adaptative traits ([@fig:diffdetail; @fig:dfe1; @fig:dfe2;
@fig:dfe3]).
Importantly, the maintenance of polygenic migration-selection equilibrium
itself *generates* correlations between selection and dominance coefficients.
Correlations between selection and dominance coefficients are often discussed
in the context of adaptation, with different factors influencing the
relationship between the homozygous effect and dominance deviation in the
DFE of new mutations [@manna2011; @agrawal2011], the DFE of the standing genetic
variation [@orr2001; @zhang2004], and the DFE of variants fixed during
adaptation [@orr2010].
We show that migration-selection balance may be another source of $s$-$h$
correlation: especially when RI is low and gene flow rather strong, recessive
alleles that are divergently maintained at equilibrium tend to have higher
selection coefficients than dominant alleles, even when no such correlation
exists *a priori* ([@fig:dfecomp]).


## Limitations of the model

Throughout, we have ignored physical linkage of the loci under selection.
When recombination is strong relative to selection (i.e. linkage is weak), the
above theory should work with minor modifications.
However, accounting for tight linkage using an approach like ours, based on
plugging in a suitable effective migration rate in single locus theory, is
likely not straightforward.
Associations between tightly linked loci will be broken down by recombination at
rates comparable to or slower than their elimination by selection, increasing
the strength of coupling [@barton1983; @kruuk1999] and rendering the separation of
time scales argument inappropriate.
The relative importance of the barrier due to linked versus unlinked loci
depends on the total map length as well as the number of selected loci.
For organisms with a limited number of chromosomes (e.g. *Drosophila*), linkage
may be important, whereas with larger chromosome numbers, most of the barrier
may be due to unlinked loci.
Secondly, we have assumed that local fitness is determined by an additive trait
under directional selection, considering a history where a rapid polygenic
selection response has driven allele frequencies at $L$ loci up near fixation.
Thus, we effectively assume that the locally adapted population is not yet
close to a fitness optimum, so that we can ignore stabilizing selection.
However, when there is abundant standing variation, a polygenic selection
response may initially only involve subtle changes in allele frequencies
[@sella2019; @hayward2022], and there may be considerable genetic redundancy
[@yeaman2015; @barghi2020], leading to a scenario that is quite different from
the one assumed in this paper.
The extent of reproductive isolation that can be maintained when these aspects
of polygenic adaptation become important remains unclear and likely requires
different approaches.
More generally, our focus on the maintenance of polygenic local adaptation and
the reproductive isolation it causes provides only half of the picture, as we
have both ignored the initial polygenic response, and the further building up
of divergence in the face of gene flow.
We have considered how a *given* genetic architecture underlying local adaptation
results in observable patterns of adaptive differentiation at equilibrium, but
remain ignorant about just what sort of genetic variation is likely the source
of local adaptation, neither have we considered how the resulting barrier to
gene flow promotes further divergence.
All these are important topics deserving further study if we are to understand
how populations can remain locally adapted when subjected to maladaptive gene
flow, and, ultimately, the adaptive processes that could drive the origin of
new species.

# Appendix

## Single locus allele frequency dynamics for weak selection \label{sec:app1}

Consider a single locus in a population of organisms with a haplodiplontic life
cycle. We assume a finite number $n$ of alleles exist at the locus. Let $p_i$,
$i \in [0..n-1]$, denote the frequency of the $i$th allele ($\all_i$).
Ignoring mutation and migration for now, the change in allele frequency of an
allele $\all_i$ throughout the life cycle is assumed to take the form:
\begin{align}
  \underbrace{
  p_i \underset{\text{haploid selection}}{\longrightarrow}
  p_i^\ast \underset{\text{gametogenesis}}{\longrightarrow}
  p_i^\ast }_{\text{haploid (gametophytic) phase}} 
  \underset{\text{syngamy}}{\longrightarrow}
  \underbrace{p_i^\ast \underset{\text{diploid selection}}{\longrightarrow}
  p_i' \underset{\text{meiosis}}
  {\longrightarrow}}_{\text{diploid (sporophytic) phase}} 
  p_i',
\end{align}
where we have assumed that gametogenesis, syngamy and spore formation do not
affect the allele frequencies[^ast]. 
Generally, migration could take place at any stage in the life cycle, for
instance right after meiosis (e.g. dispersal of meiospores in bryophytes and
Fungi), at the end of the haploid phase (e.g. gamete dispersal in algae), early
in the diploid phase (e.g. seed dispersal in spermatophytes) or at the level of
adult diploids (e.g. migration in animals).

[^ast]: Note that we use $p_i^\ast$ to label the allele frequency after haploid
selection, whereas in the main text we use this to denote the mainland allele
frequency. Here we are not considering migration however. 

Let the relative haploid fitness of a haploid individual carrying allele $i$ be
$1 + \eps s_i$, defined as the relative contribution to the diploid
(sporophytic) generation within the haploid (gametophytic) generation.
Similarly, we let $1+\eps s_{ij}$ denote the relative fitness of a diploid
individual with genotype $\all_i \all_j$.
The allele frequency change over a single generation is determined by the
following dynamical system:
\begin{align}
  p_i^\ast &= \frac{w_{h,i}}{\bar{w}_{h}(p)} p_i \nonumber \\
  p_i' &= \frac{w_{d,i}(p^\ast)}{\bar{w}_d(p^\ast)}p_i^\ast \qquad 1 \le i \le n,
  \label{eq:ds}
\end{align}
where $p = (p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n)$ (and similarly for $p^\ast$). The marginal
fitnesses $w_{h,i}$ and $w_{d,i}$ associated with allele $\all_i$ in the
haploid (gametophytic) and diploid (sporophytic) phase respectively are
\begin{align*}
  w_{h,i} &= 1 + \eps s_i \\
  w_{d,i}(p) &= \sum_j (1+\eps s_{ij})p_j = 1 + \eps \sum_j s_{ij}p_j := 1 +
  \eps \bar{s}_{d,i}.
\end{align*}
The mean fitnesses in the gametophytic and sporophytic phases are
\begin{align*}
  \bar{w}_h(p) &= \sum_i (1+\eps s_i)p_i := 1 + \eps \bar{s}_h \\
  \bar{w}_d(p) &= \sum_i \sum_j (1+\eps s_{ij})p_ip_j := 1 + \eps \bar{s_d}
\end{align*}
The allele frequency change over a single alternation of generations for the
dynamical system defined in @eq:ds has the usual form
  \begin{equation}
  \Delta p_i = \frac{\bar{w}_i - \bar{w}}{\bar{w}} p_i
  \label{eq:change}
  \end{equation}
Where, from @eq:ds, we have 
\begin{equation}
  \bar{w} = \Big(1 + \epsilon \sum_j \sum_k
  \frac{(1+\epsilon s_j)p_j (1+\epsilon s_k)p_k}{(1+\eps \bar{s}_h)^2} s_{jk}\Big) 
  (1+\eps \bar{s}_h) = 
  1 + \eps \bar{s}_h + \frac{\eps \bar{s}_s}{(1+\epsilon \bar{s}_h)^2} +
    O(\epsilon^2)
  \label{eq:wm}
\end{equation}
and
  $$
  \bar{w_i} = \Big(1 + \epsilon
    \frac{\sum_j s_{ij}(1+\eps s_j)p_j}{1+\eps \sum_k s_k p_k}\Big)
    (1+\eps s_i)
  = 1 + \eps s_i
  + \frac{\eps \bar{s}_{s,i}}{(1 + \eps \bar{s}_h)}+
    O(\epsilon^2),
  $$
so that
  \begin{equation}
  \bar{w_i} - \bar{w}
  = \epsilon (s_i - \bar{s}_h)
  + \frac{\epsilon}{(1 + \epsilon \bar{s}_h)^2} (\bar{s}_{d,i} - \bar{s}_d)
  + O(\epsilon^2).
  \label{eq:diff}
  \end{equation}
Assuming the intensity of selection per generation is weak (all $s$ are small)
and that $\eps$ measures the generation time, we obtain a continuous-time model
of allele frequency change by considering the per-generation change in allele
frequency and taking the limit as $\eps$ goes to zero, specifically, plugging
@eq:diff and @eq:wm in @eq:change, we get
\begin{align}
  \dot{p_i} = \lim_{\eps \rightarrow 0}
     \frac{\Delta p_i}{\epsilon} &= 
  \big[(s_i - \bar{s}_h) + (\bar{s}_{d,i} - \bar{s}_d)\big]p_i \nonumber \\
  &= (\bar{s}_i - \bar{s})p_i,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
    \bar{s}_i &= s_i + \bar{s}_{d,i} = s_i + \sum_{j}s_{ij}p_j \nonumber \\
    \bar{s} &= \bar{s}_h + \bar{s}_{d} = \sum_i s_i p_i + \sum_i \sum_j s_{ij}
    p_i p_j.
    \label{eq:malth}
\end{align}
This has the same form as the classical diploid or haploid continuous-time
model of allele frequency change[^fn] but with marginal and mean Malthusian
fitnesses given by $\bar{s}_i$ and $\bar{s}$ respectively.

As an example, consider the biallelic case with alleles $\all_0$ and $\all_1$,
so that $s_0 = s_{00} = 0$, $p_0 = p$ and $p_1=q$. Note that we shall always
assume $s_{ij} = s_{ji}$.  We have from @eq:malth $\bar{s}_1 = s_1 + s_{01}p +
s_{11}q$ and $\bar{s} = s_1q + 2s_{01}pq + s_{11}q^2$. Some algebra shows that
we can write the ODE for the frequency of the selected allele ($\all_1$) as
  \begin{equation}
  \dot{q} = (\bar{s}_1 - \bar{s})q = pq(s_a + s_bq)
  \label{eq:biall}
  \end{equation}
where $s_a = s_1 + s_{01}$ and $s_b = s_{11} - 2s_{01}$.
As expected, this is the same dynamical law as for the strictly diploid model,
in which case the dynamics of the selected allele are given by @eq:biall but
with $s_a = s_{01}$.
This enables us to identify a pair of 'effective' selection coefficients,
  \begin{align}
  s_{01}^\ast = s_1 + s_{01} \nonumber \\
  s_{11}^\ast = 2s_1 + s_{11},
  \end{align}
so that, for weak selection, a diploid biallelic model with parameters
$s_{01}^\ast$ and $s_{11}^\ast$ yields the same allele frequency dynamics[^fit]
as a haplodiplontic model with parameters $s_1, s_{01}$ and $s_{11}$.

[^fn]: The same result can be obtained in a less cumbersome manner by
first noting that, under the assumption of weak selection, allele frequency
changes within a single alternation of generations are negligible, so that
$w_{s,i}(p^\ast) = w_{s,i}(p)$ and $\bar{w}_s(p^\ast) = \bar{w}_s(p)$ in
@eq:ds.

[^fit]: Note that a diploid model with these effective parameters does *not*
yield the same mean fitness (and hence genetic load) as a haplodiplontic model
in the original parameterization if we define mean fitness in the continuous
time model as $\sum_i e^{s_i} p_i \big(\sum_j e^{s_{ij}} p_j\big)$.


## Equilibrium structure of the mainland-island model \label{sec:mieq}

We describe the equilibrium structure of the haplodiplontic single-locus
deterministic mainland-island model for the biallelic case. The dynamics are
given by the ODE
  \begin{align}
    \dot{q} = - \dot{p} 
    &= m\Delta q + pq(s_a + s_b q) \label{eq:ode1} \\
    &= m\Delta q + pq(s_1 + s_{01} + (s_{11} - 2s_{01}) q),
  \end{align}
where $q$ is the frequency of the locally selected allele $\all_1$, and $p=1-q$
is the frequency of the allele with relative fitness of 1 on the island when
homozygous.

When $m=0$ (no migration), there will be an admissible fixed point when either
of the following conditions holds
\begin{align}
  s_{01} &> -s_1 \text{ and } s_{01} > s_1 + s_{11} \\
  s_{01} &< -s_1 \text{ and } s_{01} < s_1 + s_{11} ,
\end{align}
i.e. when there is *ploidally antagonistic selection*, diploid over- or
underdominance, or both.
The fixed point is obtained at
  \begin{equation}
  \tilde{p} = \frac{s_a + s_b}{s_a} = \frac{s_1 + s_{11} - s_{01}}{s_{11} - 2s_{01}}
  \end{equation}
This will correspond to a stable polymorphism whenever $s_{01} > 0$. This case
was first analyzed in a discrete-time model by @scudo1967.

Now consider $m>0$. We shall assume that $\Delta q = q_{\text{mainland}} - q =
1-q = p$, i.e. the mainland is fixed for the locally selected allele.  To
describe the equilibrium behavior, it is helpful to factor the dynamical law as
  \begin{equation}
  \dot{q} = mp\left(1+ \frac{s_a}{m}q + \frac{s_b}{m}q^2\right)
  \label{eq:quad}
  \end{equation}
Linear stability at a fixed point $\tilde{q}$ is determined by
  \begin{align}
  \frac{d\dot{q}}{dq}\big|_{\tilde{q}} 
    &= (s_a - m) + 2(s_b-s_a)\tilde{q} -3s_b \tilde{q}^2
  \end{align}
If $s_b = 0$, we have an effectively haploid model (i.e. *genic selection*),
and will have a stable polymorphic equilibrium at $\tilde{q} = -m/s_a$ whenever
$m < -s_a$, and a stable boundary equilibrium at $\tilde{q} = 1$ when $m >
-s_a$.
When $s_b \ne 0$, polymorphic equilibria, when they exist, will correspond to
the roots of the quadratic expression in parentheses in @eq:quad. These are
  $$q_-, q_+ = \frac{-s_a/m \pm \sqrt{(s_a/m)^2 - 4s_b/m}}{2s_b/m}$$
We have the following biologically relevant equilibria:
       
![Equilibrium and stability behavior of the single-locus biallelic
haplodiplontic mainland-island model. The dark gray zone indicates the
parameter region where there is a single protected stable polymorphic
equilibrium. The light gray zone shows the parameter region where there is both
a stable (but unprotected) and an unstable polymorphic equilibrium.
$s_1$, $s_{01}$ and $s_{11}$ are the haploid and diploid selection coefficients
for the invading allele ($\all_1$) on the island.
\label{fig:stab}](/home/arthur_z/vimwiki/build/notes/img/quadstab.pdf){width=40%}

i. $\tilde{q}=1$ (*swamping*) is always a stable equilibrium when $m > -(s_a + s_b)$.
ii. When $0 < m < -(s_a + s_b)$ there is always a single stable polymorphic
   equilibrium at $q_-$ (dark gray zone in @fig:stab) and $q_+$ will not lie in
   $[0,1]$.
iii. When $-(s_a + s_b) < m < s_b$ and $4s_b/m < (s_a/m)^2 \iff 4m < s_a^2/s_b$, there is,
   besides the stable boundary equilibrium at $\tilde{q}=1$, an unstable
   (repelling) equilibrium at $q_+$, and a stable polymorphic equilibrium at
   $q_-$ (light gray zone in @fig:stab).

The relation between the key parameters $s_a/m$ and $s_b/m$ and the equilibrium
behavior of the system when $m>0$ is illustrated in @fig:stab.

When condition (iii) holds, sharp thresholds for swamping are observed, in
which case there is a certain critical allele frequency $p_c$ below which no
local adaptation cannot be maintained whatever the migration rate.
We can ask for which degree of dominance such sharp thresholds for swamping can
possibly be observed. 
From @eq:quad we see that at an equilibrium which does not correspond to $p=0$,
the condition $f(q) = m + s_a q + s_bq^2 = 0$ holds.
A sufficient condition for observing a sharp threshold is that $f$ obtains a
maximum for some $q < 1$, hence that $f'(1) > 0$ where $f'(q) = s_a + 2s_bq$.
This will be the case whenever $s_a + 2s_b > 0$.
In the diploid case with the usual parameterization where $s_a = -sh$ and $s_b
= -s(1-2h)$, this shows that critical behavior is expected as soon as $h >
2/3$.


## Fixed point iteration algorithm {#sec:fp}

Our approximations yield a system of equations for the expected allele
frequencies and heterozygosities on the island which are coupled through the
gff.
To calculate expected allele frequencies and allele frequency distributions at
equilibrium, we solve the system self-consistently by performing a fixed point
iteration.
In words: for a given initial set of allele frequencies and heterozygosities,
we calculate the gff at each locus using @eq:gff; using these gff values, we
next calculate expected allele frequencies and heterozygosities at each locus
using numerical quadrature.
This process is repeated until convergence.
The algorithm is more formally outlined in algorithm \autoref{alg:fp}.

## Swamping thresholds for the deterministic multilocus model {#sec:supdet}

We now take a closer look at the equilibria of @eq:odeq and their critical
behavior.
Clearly, $p=0$ is always a solution of @eq:odeq, and it will correspond to a locally stable
equilibrium (i.e. swamping) whenever $m/s > 1-h$.
Other equilibria, when they exist, are given by the zeros of the function
\begin{equation}
  f(p) = hq + (1-2h)q^2 - \frac{m}{s}g[p] \label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}
Note that $g[p] > 0$ and we assume $s > 0$, so that for any fixed $h$, as $m$
increases, there will indeed be a critical migration rate beyond which $f(p) <
0$, from which point onwards the only stable equilibrium will be $p=0$.
At the critical point, the equilibrium allele frequency will satisfy the
additional constraint $f'(p) = 0$ (see @fig:mlstab), i.e.
  \begin{align}
  f'(p) &= h + 2(1-2h)q - 2Lm(1 - 3h - 2(1-2h)q)g[p] = 0 
  \label{eq:eq2}
  \end{align}
We can solve @eq:eq1 for $g[p]$, and then plug in $g[p]$ in @eq:eq2.
This yields a cubic polynomial in $p$ which can be solved for the allele
frequency $p_c$ at the critical point:
\begin{equation}
    0=Ls ((1-h)^{2}- 2p^{3} (1-2h)^2 + p^{2} (14 h^{2} - 17 h + 5) - p (7 h^{2} -
    11 h + 4)) -1 + \frac{3}{2} h + (1 - 2 h)p 
\end{equation}
We can then plug $p_c$ into @eq:eq1 and solve for $m_c/s$.
While the general expressions yield not much insight, we can focus on a number
of special cases.

Firstly, in the additive case ($h=0.5$), a critical point different from $1-h$
appears when $Ls > 1$, in which case the equilibrium frequency at the critical
point will be $p_c = 1-1/Ls$. The corresponding critical migration rate is
  $$\frac{m_c}{s} = \frac{e^{Ls-1}}{2Ls}.$$
In the case where local adaptation is due to dominant alleles ($h=0$), we have
again critical behavior as soon as $Ls>1$, with the swamping threshold
occurring at $m/s=1$ otherwise.
In this case, we find
\begin{align*}
    p_c &= \frac{3}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{L s(Ls + 8)}}{4 L s} < \frac{1}{2}, 
  & \frac{m_c}{s} = 
    \left(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{L s \left(L s + 8\right)}}{4Ls}\right)^{2} e^{\frac{L s}{4}
    + \frac{\sqrt{L s \left(L s + 8\right)}}{4} - 1}.
\end{align*}
In contrast with the additive case (where as $Ls$ increases, arbitrary
equilibrium differentiation can be maintained near the critical point),
equilibrium differentiation will be below $0.5$ near $m_c$ when $h=0$.
Lastly, for recessive local adaptation ($h=1$), we have bistable critical
behavior for all $Ls > 0$. The equilibrium frequency at the critical point is
always larger than $1/2$ and is given by the zeros of the cubic polynomial
  $$4 Ls p^{3} - 4 Ls p^{2} + 2 p - 1 = 0$$
for which we have no simple expressions. A fair approximation for $Ls < 1.5$ is
given by
\begin{align*}
  p_c &\approx \frac{1}{2} + \frac{Ls}{4}, 
  & \frac{m_c}{s} \approx \left(\frac{1}{4} - \frac{(L s)^2}{16}  \right) 
  e^{\left(\frac{Ls}{2}\right)^{3} +  \left(\frac{L s}{\sqrt 2}\right)^2 +
    \frac{Ls}{2}}
\end{align*}
The swamping threshold is seen to increase strongly with increasing $Ls$.

## Sensitivity to initial conditions {#sec:init}

![
Different apparent equilibria depending on initial conditions.
In the left plot, the yellow line ($p_0 = 1$) indicates the expected allele
frequencies as determined using the fixed point iteration of algorithm
\autoref{alg:fp}, starting with $p^{(0)} = (1,1,\dots,1)$ (i.e. secondary
contact, maximal initial differentiation), whereas the green line assumes
$p^{(0)} = (0,0,\dots,0)$ (no initial differentiation). The dots show
results from individual-based simulations with the same initial conditions
(50000 generation, keeping the last 25000 and subsampling every 5 generations).
The three plots on the right show the evolution of the fixed point iteration
for different initial initial conditions $p^{(0)} = (p_0, p_0, \dots, p_0)$ for
three values of $m$.  Note the bifurcation of the dynamical system defined by
the algorithm: for $m/s = 0.2$ and $m/s=0.4$ there is a single globally stable
fixed point, whereas for $m/s = 0.3$, there are two locally stable fixed
points.
\label{fig:bifurcation}

Although the equilibrium allele frequency distribution should be independent of
the initial condition (the individual-based model can be thought of as an
ergodic Markov chain on the space of $N$ $L$-locus genotypes), for appreciable
$Ls$, the observed allele frequency distribution in any finite-time simulation
can depend strongly on the initial conditions (that is, as $Ls$ increases,
stochastic jumps between the different modes of the $L$-dimensional joint
allele frequency distribution become increasingly less likely, and occur on
time scales that are neither biologically relevant nor computationally
feasible).
This is especially true in the strongly recessive case ($h > 2/3$) and when LD
is substantial.
This is similar to the behavior in the deterministic model: when $Ls$ or $h$ is
sufficiently large, and sharp swamping thresholds appear, the system is
bistable, and the polymorphic equilibrium cannot be reached when the initial
condition corresponds to a state of no or little differentiation.

The fixed point iteration will in that case converge to an expectation computed
near one of the modes of the allele frequency distribution (see
@fig:bifurcation for an illustration).
In other words, considering the fixed point iteration outlined in algorithm
\autoref{alg:fp} as a discrete dynamical system, and treating $m/s$ as a
bifurcation parameter, two bifurcation points occur succesively, as shown in
@fig:bifurcation. For small $m/s$, a single globally stable polymorphic
equilibrium is obtained. After the first bifurcation point, this equilibrium
ceases to be globally stable, and a second locally stable equilibrium
corresponding to almost no differentiation appears. After the second
bifurcation point the lower equilibrium becomes globally stable.
The region of parameter space where the two stable equilibria coexist
corresponds to the situation where the assumption of population genetic
equilibrium becomes questionable, where the state of the population after a
large but finite time of evolution depends strongly on the detailed history of
the population. 


## Distribution of fitness effects (DFE) models \label{sec:dfe}

![
Joint distributions for an example of each of the three DFE models outlined in
@sec:dfe. The joint probability density is shown on a logarithmic scale, with
yellow marking high density and (deep) blue low density.
The marginal density for the selection coefficient is a Gamma distribution with
$\kappa = 2/3, 1, 3/2$ in the top, middle and bottom row respectively (see
@sec:dfe for the relevant definitions).

Marginal distributions of $s$ and $h$ for the three example DFE model shown in
@fig:dfejoint. \label{fig:dfemarg}

### Independent selection and dominance coefficients

For the independent model, we assume, for $i=1,\dots,L$,
\begin{align*}
    s_i &\sim \Gam(\kappa, \lambda) \\
    h_i &\sim \Beta(\alpha, \beta),
\end{align*}
where $\kappa$ is the shape parameter of the Gamma distribution, and $\lambda$
the rate parameter (i.e. the Gamma distribution with density $f(s) =
\Gamma(\kappa)^{-1}\lambda^{\kappa} s^{\kappa-1}e^{-\lambda s}$).
The mean is $\kappa/\lambda$, so that $\lambda = \kappa/\bar{s}$. 
The variance is $\kappa/\lambda^2 = \bar{s}^2/\kappa \propto \kappa^{-1}$ and
the excess kurtosis is similarly $\propto \kappa^{-1}$. Decreasing $\kappa$
therefore increases simultaneously the variance and kurtosis of $s$ across the
barrier.
For $\kappa = 1$, this reduces to the Exponential distribution with rate
$\lambda$.
See @fig:dfejoint (A) and @fig:dfemarg for examples.

### Logistic model

In the logistic model, we assume, for $i=1,\dots,L$,
\begin{align*}
    s_i &\sim \Gam(\kappa, \lambda) \\
    \logit h_i |s_i &\sim \text{Normal}(a + b\log s_i,
    \sigma^2),
\end{align*}
where $\logit h = \log\frac{h}{1-h}$ is the logit transform.
In other words, we assume $h$ to be distributed according to a linear
regression on $\log s$ with slope $a$ and intercept $b$, on a logit scale.
The marginal density of $h$ is then
  $$f(h) = \frac{1}{h(1-h)}\int_0^\infty \mathrm{N}[\logit h ; a +
     b\log(s),\sigma] \mathrm{G}(s; \kappa, \lambda)ds\ ,$$
where $\mathrm{N}(\cdot; \mu, \sigma)$ and $\mathrm{G}(\cdot;\kappa,\lambda)$
denote the density functions for the Normal distribution (with mean $\mu$ and
standard deviation $\sigma$) and Gamma distribution respectively.
Instead of setting the $a$ and $b$ parameters directly, we parameterize the
regression by choosing two reference pointst, $s^{(1)}$ and $s^{(2)}$, together
with their respective expected dominance coefficients $h^{(1)} =
\Ex[h|s^{(1)}]$ and $h^{(2)}= \Ex[h|s^{(2)}]$ using
\begin{align*}
    b &= \frac{\logit h^{(2)} - \logit h^{(1)}}{\log s^{(2)} - \log s^{(1)}} \\
    a &= \logit h^{(1)} - b\log s^{(1)}
\end{align*}
This model is also illustrated in @fig:dfejoint (B) and @fig:dfemarg.

### Model after @caballero1994 

In the model of @caballero1994 (see also @zhang2004 and discussion in
@agrawal2011), referred to as CK94, we assume
\begin{align*}
    s_i &\sim \Gam(\kappa, \lambda) \\
    h_i^\ast | s_i &\sim \text{Uniform}(0,e^{-Ks}) \\
    h_i &= 1 - h_i^\ast
\end{align*}
It should be noted that this distribution is supposed to be a reasonable model
for dominance coefficients of deleterious mutations at mutation-stabilizing
selection equilibrium, where mutations of large effect segregating at
appreciable frequencies tend to be recessive.
In our case, we regard this as the distribution of dominance coefficients of
*mutant* alleles on the *mainland* that constitutes the standing variation
which is the source of locally adaptive alleles during the initial polygenic
response (which we do not explicitly model).
These are hence the dominance coefficients of the locally *beneficial* alleles
on the *island* (assuming dominance coefficients to be constant across
environments and genetic backgrounds).
The $h_i$ as we defined them are however the dominance coefficients of the
invading wild-type alleles from the mainland over the locally beneficial ones,
so that we use $h_i = 1-h_i^\ast$ where the $h_i^\ast$ are distributed
according to the CK94 model.
We set the $K$ parameter so that $\Ex[h^\ast] = \bar{h}$ for some $\bar{h}$, i.e.
  $$K =  \lambda \left((2\bar{h})^{-\frac{1}{\kappa}} - 1 \right).$$
The marginal density for $h^\ast$ is
\begin{align*}
  f(h) &= 
  \int_0^{-\frac{\log h}{K}} \frac{\lambda^\kappa}{\Gamma(\kappa)}
    \lambda^\kappa s^{\kappa-1} e^{-(\lambda - K)s} ds \\
    &= \left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda - K}\right)^\kappa
  \int_0^{-\frac{\log h}{K}} \frac{(\lambda - K)^\kappa}{\Gamma(\kappa)}
    \lambda^\kappa s^{\kappa-1} e^{-(\lambda - K)s} ds 
    = \left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda - K}\right)^\kappa
  \int_0^{-\frac{\log h}{K}} \mathrm{G}(s;\kappa,\lambda - K)ds \\
    &= \left(\frac{\lambda}{\lambda - K}\right)^\kappa
       \frac{\gamma\left(\kappa, -(\lambda - K) \frac{\log h}{K}\right)}{\Gamma(\kappa)}
\end{align*}
where $\gamma$ is the lower incomplete gamma function.
This model is also illustrated in @fig:dfejoint (C) and @fig:dfemarg.
To study the effect of a negative correlation between $s$ and $h$ (i.e. where
strongly selected locally beneficial alleles tend to be dominant), we use the
same model, but with $h_i = h_i^\ast$. We refer to this model as CK94$^\ast$
(see @fig:dfe4).
